    Change Management is going through an exercise to bring change about in this company. And one of the main effective ways to enforce and factor the change in the company would be through monitoring the required time each employee devoted to the company. In doing so, the Change Management team would see a change of attitude in work and punctuality in every work place throughout the company.
